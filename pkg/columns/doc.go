// Package columns contains an implementation of the Columns video game. From Wikipedia:
// 		Columns is a match-three puzzle video game created by Jay Geertsen in 1989.
// 		The area of play is enclosed within a tall, rectangular playing area. Columns of three different symbols (such as differently-colored
// 		jewels) appear, one at a time, at the top of the well and fall to the bottom, landing either on the floor or on top of
// 		previously-fallen "columns". While a column is falling, the player can move it left and right, and can also cycle the positions
// 		of the symbols within it. After a column lands, if three or more of the same symbols are connected in a horizontal, vertical,
// 		or diagonal line, those symbols disappear. The pile of columns then settles under gravity. If this resettlement causes three or
// 		more other symbols to align, they too disappear and the cycle repeats. Occasionally, a special column with a
// 		multicolor Magic Jewel appears. It destroys all the jewels with the same color as the one underneath it.
// 		The columns fall at a faster rate as the player progresses. The goal of the game is to play for as long as possible before the well
// 		fills up with jewels, which ends the game. Players can score up to 99,999 points.
